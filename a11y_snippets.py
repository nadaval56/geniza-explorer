"""
Geniza Explorer — the accessibility/privacy markup that every page carries.

Both generators need the exact same two blocks: build.py for index.html and
fragment.html, prerender.py for the ~36K document pages and the static index.
Keeping them here means the snippet is written once, and a change to the
accessibility menu cannot drift between the home page and a document page.

The snippets are plain strings and are *not* run through str.format(), so the
braces in the inline JavaScript stay single. Callers interpolate them into
their own templates through a named placeholder.

    head(root)   goes in <head>, after the site stylesheet
    foot(root)   goes immediately before </body>

`root` is the relative path back to the site root ("" at the top level,
"../" under d/), the same value the templates already use for assets.

    visitor who chose high contrast watch the page load in the normal palette
    and then flip, on every single page view.
